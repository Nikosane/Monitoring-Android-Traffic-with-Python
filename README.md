# Monitoring-Android-Traffic-with-Python

In this guide, we'll walk through several methods to monitor network traffic from an Android device using Python. This is useful for debugging app behavior, analyzing network requests, or studying traffic patterns. Weâ€™ll use tools like pyshark, tcpdump, and mitmproxy to capture and analyze network data.

Requirements :
    Wireshark and Tshark (for pyshark method)
    tcpdump (for Android packet capture)
    mitmproxy (for HTTP/HTTPS traffic monitoring)
    ADB (Android Debug Bridge)
